  <h1>Templates</h1>

  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">Read more about
      templates here.</a>
  </p>

  <p>We know about variables. We know about Strings. We will now learn about But how to we put them together?</p>
  <p> We use backticks and ${ }. Have a look at an example</p>

  <h2>Example 1</h2>
  <p>Lets look at some variables and write them out in a string.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let playerName;
      playerName = "John";
      document.write(`Hi, ${playerName}. Welcome to the game!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let dinnerItem;
      dinnerItem = "Lasagna";
      document.write(`We are having ${dinnerItem}, tonight!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let fruit;
      fruit = "strawberry";
      document.write(`It's ${fruit} season.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Example 2</h2>
  <p>You can have as many variables as you want. You can even use numbers!</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let a;
      let b;
      let c;

      a = 12;
      b = 3;
      c = a + b;
      document.write(`${a} plus ${b} is equal to ${c}.`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      c = a * b;
      document.write(`${a} times ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      a = 512;
      b = 64;
      c = a / b;
      document.write(`${a} divided by ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Try it!</h2> 
  <p>Now you try it!</p>
  <p>Make at least 5 more examples of templates yourself.</p>

  <p>
    <script>
      let firstname = "Andre";
      let lastname = "Morris";
      document.write(` ${firstname} ${lastname} is the cutest baby in the world! `)

    

    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
       let score;
      score = 2000;
      let hiScore;
      hiScore = 2001;
      document.write(`Current Score: ${score}  
 | High Score: ${hiScore}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      let item = "Shampoo";
      let message = `Hi ${firstName} are you still interested in buying your ${item}?`
      document.write(message);
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      let firstName;
      // let lastName;
      let age;

      firstName = "Nick";
      lastName = "Morris";
      age = 33;

      document.write(`Hello ${firstName}. Your last name is ${lastName}.  You are ${age}         years old.`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      let show1;
      let show2;
      show1 = "Bridgerton";
      show2 = "House of the Dragon";
      document.write(`My current favorite shows to watch are ${show1} and   ${show2}. They are so entertaining!`)
    </script>
  </p>

   <p>
    <script>
      let fooditem;
      let fooditem2;
      fooditem = "gumbo";
      fooditem2 = "grilledcheese";
      document.write(` I love ${fooditem} with ${fooditem2}.`)
    </script>
   </p>
